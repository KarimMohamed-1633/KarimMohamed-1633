My name is Karim Mohamed. I'm an ambitious student at the esteemed University of Bristol, pursuing a comprehensive education in BEng Computer Science and Electronics. With a steadfast commitment to continuous improvement, I am focused on showcasing my technical abilities, specialising in Java, Python, Go, and C. My repository serves as a testament to my dedication and proficiency in software development. My projects are either built from the ground up or based on skeleton code provided by my university. I am committed to perfecting my academic endeavours, but still strive to work on extracurricular projects in order to enhance my current skillset.
